This library is a Ruby binding for injecting into a raw HFS+ file
and converting it to DMG.  Also, this binding injects resources
into EXEs.

The DMG / HFS+ is GPL'd code that is part of the amazing XPwn
tool: http://github.com/planetbeing/xpwn.  The authors are
many: http://wikee.iphwn.org/#who_we_are.

I also am including a header (pe.h) by Michael Kohn, author of
the anal_pe inspection tool.

As such, this library is also GPL.  See the LICENSE file for
more.
