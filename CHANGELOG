= Walkabout - Shoes 3.3
  The name reflects back to when Shoes creator why_the_lucky_stiff disappeared
  from the internet. He went walkabout! We changed some icons and backgrounds
  to relect that whimsical theme.  
  
  Walkabout (3.3) will be less compatible with the unmaintained 3.1 and 4.0 (jRuby)
  We have interesting ideas of we what we do with Shoes that maybe very difficult
  to immplememt in Shoes 4. 
  
-------------- Shoes 3.3.2 ----------------------------------

=== New with 3.3.2
  * Rudimentary profiler. Fun and pretty but may not be all that useful. Written in
    Shoes so you can modify it if you like. May not work on Windows.
  * Shoes.show_console is now Shoes.terminal with many options for size, and
    colors. It can handle some common escape sequences (colors etc)  
    On Windows:
      Use Msys>  cshoes.exe
      or install one of those ANSI dll things for your DOS era console. 
      Rumor: Win 10 does support ansi escape sequences on it's console.
    Useful for running unit tests of Shoes and other weird stuff.

=== Fixed with 3.3.2
  * A new launch script for OSX (cshoes) that works like Linux and Windows
    from the command line.
  * Windows: bug261 - fix font loading

=== Developer isssues for 3.3.2
  * Most of the above are developer issues. osx cshoes is the biggest
    followed by some command line parsing changes.
  
----------------------------------------------------------
  
=== New with 3.3.1
  * Video widget. If you have VLC installed, Shoes will find it (and
    you can tell Shoes where your VLC is). Once found, you can use it. 
    You can not package VLC with you script however. 
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/133
    Caution: may not work on OSX < 10.10
  * Secondary packaging. Use a Shoes installer script to install your app. Not 
    for the casual. Pretty damn clever and confusing so there's likely to
    be bugs and confusion.
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/Custom-Install-Scripts
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/Command-line-package
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/188
  * Uses Ruby 2.2.4. If you have native Gems that were built by earlier
    versions, they may not work. - Uninstall and reinstall the gem. 
  * Windows: Shoes comes with win32-shortcut gem. Undocumented and the
    online docs you do find are not always up to date.  
  
=== Fixed with 3.3.1
  * start {} blocks on stacks and flows work much better. 
  * Windows: does not use FONTCONFIG_FILE env var. 
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/216
    Benefits: Faster install, multiple installs, enables merge packaging
       https://github.com/Shoes3/exe-shoes
  * Linux: fixed edit_box bug with Gtk >= 3.16
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/217
  * OSX: don't duplicate Shoes.app windows. Nasty if it happens to you. 
    Cshoes suffered from this bug too. That works better now for OSX.
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/190
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/175
  * Windows: ask_color crashes. 
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/209
  * updated wiki article on building shoes with Linux.
  * remote debugger issue with newer byebug
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/231
    
=== Developer issues for 3.3.1
  * deleted gtk2 code. Video code is included.
    Some rakefiles were modified and are slightly less confusing.
  * Windows: dependencies have changed - using  Gtk 3.10.9 
    https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/Mingw-Dependencies
    Download from http://shoes.mvmanila.com/public/shoesdeps/mingw/ming-Shoes-3.3.1.tar.gz
    if you need them - it's a huge file!

--------------------------------------------------------

=== new with 3.3.0
  * Uses Gtk3 (not gtk2) for Linux and Windows. This will change visuals
    on both platorms. 
  * add font and wrap styles for list_box. A popular request - we are
    limited to what Gtk3 can do, however. 
    The default behaviour for long strings in the list box is now to 
    ellispise ... in the middle. THIS could effect your current apps.
    Issue 109 https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/109
  * A new Svg widget to display svg images - similar to Image but 
    NOT the same. Has aspect scaling options based on the svg internals.
    See samples/good-svgview.rb. samples/good-flip.rb and the manual. 
    We also include a svg deck of playing cards. 
    It's a  bit fragile  so please file bug reports and feature requests. 
    Very verbose Issue 54 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/54
    Pay attention to the OSX workaround #178 https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/178
    Preliminary save and export methods:
    Issue #177 https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/177
  * add a refresh slot method
    Issue 152 https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/152
  * Uses ruby 2.1.7 and rubygems 2.4.7
    Issue 164 https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/164
  * New splash screen (no animation).
  * added samples/good-image-rotate.rb because it's fun to watch.
    Issue 157 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/157

=== Fixed with 3.3.0
  * OSX - do not use home brew to manage dependecies. 
    wiki: https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/OSX-10.9-Dependencies15
    wiki: https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/OSX-10.6-Dependencies
  * Remove pango-querymodules from OSX. Yay!
    Issue 156 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/156

    Issue 31 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/31
  * repaint after slot remove
    Issue 151 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/151
  * Windows: 256x256 icons failed when packaging.
    Issue 10 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/10
  * developer name and RVM and linker info gets embedded in 
    binary libraries. No solution worth persueing. 
    Issue 66 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/66
  * Windows: fontconfig problems if you build shoes and download shoes
    Issue 141 - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/141

=== New with 3.2.24
   * added show_console command for OSX and Linux to match Windows. 
     Dumber that dumb console. Works with readline if you don't expect too
     much. Although -w and --console switches do work on the command line 
     you probably don't need them now that you can call Shoes::show_console
