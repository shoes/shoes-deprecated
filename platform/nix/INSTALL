    READYING ONE'S SELF TO BUILD SHOES

    Before building, be sure you have all the right libraries installed.
    Shoes relies on Cairo, Pango, libungif, libjpeg, GTK+ 2.0, and Ruby,
    as well as GCC and its linker.

    To install all of these libraries on Ubuntu or Debian:

      # aptitude install libcairo2-dev libpixman-1-dev libpango1.0-dev \
          libungif4-dev libjpeg62-dev libgtk2.0-dev vlc libvlc-dev \
          libsqlite3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libportaudio19-dev \
          ruby1.8-dev rake

    (On Ubuntu older than 8.10, actually you'll need libvlc0-dev.)

    To install these libraries on Fedora:
     
      # yum install -y giflib-devel cairo-devel libpixman-devel \
          pango-devel libjpeg-devel gtk2-devel sqlite-devel vlc-devel \
          libcurl-devel libportaudio-devel ruby-devel

    BUILDING AND INSTALLING SHOES

    To build from the source tarball:

      $ make
      # make install

    A few options to be aware of:

      * VIDEO=1 will build in VideoLAN support.
      * PREFIX=/opt/shoes will install to /opt/shoes.

    So, a practical use of the two options would be:

      $ make VIDEO=1
      # make PREFIX=/opt/shoes install

    This source tarball should work for all Linux and BSD variants, but
    if you need help building on your platform, consult the Shoes wiki.
